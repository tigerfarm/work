Public Key Client Validation (PKCV) - Getting Started 
https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/pkcv
+ Available through the Twilio Enterprise Plan.
+ Public Key Client Validation helps organizations in compliance-heavy industries meet strict security requirements.

Client and Message Validation
When you send a request with Public Key Client Validation, Twilio validates:
    That the request comes from a sender who is in control of the private key
    That the message has not been modified in transit

+ Requires Twilio account flag enabled: Enable Public Key Client Validation
https://wiki.hq.twilio.com/display/COM/Client-Validation+Tech+Spec

+ Account and Key Management with API Keys
https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/pkcv/account-and-key-management-api-keys
To manage API Keys and Accounts, via the API, after enforcing Public Key Client Validation a Master API Key is required. 
Once Public Key Client Validation is enforced, 
requests with Auth Tokens will not be successful anymore and by default, 
API Keys are not permitted to manage Accounts or Keys.

Quickstart: This guide will walk you through the steps of implementing Public Key Client Validation.

https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/pkcv/quickstart

The quickstart recommend generating the RSA key pair using the OpenSSL toolkit.
https://www.openssl.org/
+ Generate a keypair using OpenSSL:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cryptography/Generate_a_keypair_using_OpenSSL

I updated my OpenSSL version on my MacBook:
````
$ brew install openssl
...
Error: openssl 1.0.2s is already installed
To upgrade to 1.0.2t, run `brew upgrade openssl`
$ brew upgrade openssl
...
````
Generate: private_key.pem
````
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private_key.pem 2048
Enter pass phrase for private_key.pem:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for private_key.pem:
$
````
Generate: public_key.pem
````
$ openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
Enter pass phrase for private_key.pem:
writing RSA key
