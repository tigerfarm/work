			<string>Dear _____ ,

Thank you for contacting Twilio Support. Great question! 

Statuses change over the course of the life of the message, so you may receive several of these statuses before the message reaches it's final status. Here's the breakdown:

Queued &amp; Sending: The message enters the queue before it is sent. It may stay in the queue for less than a second, for several seconds, or possibly longer, depending on availability. Sending only takes a fraction of a second. Queuing and Sending happen before there is a status callback.

Sent/Failed: This is generally the first status you will see. Sent indicates that Twilio was successful in handing the message off to our upstream partner. Sent does not confirm that the message was received by the recipient, though that probably did happen. Failed indicates that Twilio was unable to do this for some reason, and should be accompanied by an error code. It is good to note that for some messages and some carriers, Sent will be the final status for the message, as not all carriers support delivery notifications.

Delivered/Undelivered: This is a status that is only received if the downstream carrier supports delivery receipts. If they do, they will send the receipt back to Twilio and we will update the status with Delivered, if the message made it to its destination, or Undelivered, if it did not, and more information will be given in the error, if it is available. The message will not be retried. Note: The carrier must convey the delivery information to Twilio within a 1 hour window in order for the status callback to be updated.

You can access a handy reference guide for the statuses here: https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/message#sms-status-values

Please let me know if you have further questions. 

Thanks, </string>
