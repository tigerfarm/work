# Conversations Quickstart App for Android Notes

The app is a lightweight Android application for [Twilio Conversations](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations).

Conversations Android Quickstart 
[GitHub link](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/conversations-quickstart-android) with a brief Readme file, and
the [documentation link](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/android/exploring-conversations-android-quickstart).

The general Twilio Conversations quickstart [link](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/quickstart).

## Configuring and getting started

You'll need to have a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/console).

You'll need a Conversations Service SID(starts with IS).
Twilio Console [link](https://www.twilio.com/console/conversations/services) to create a Conversations service. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Issues

Issues I worked through:
+ Get the webhook to work, when a message is added.
+ Android Studio updates: add an emulator for Android 11.
+ Get the access token to work.

The Conversations webhook only works for:
+ The [Default Conversation Service SID](https://www.twilio.com/console/conversations/configuration/defaults)
    when using API calls such as my command line programs.
+ SDK calls will trigger webhooks from services other than the Default Conversation Service SID.
    I haven't tested this, but I got it for a reliable source.

Adding an emulator is straight forward. And my new phone was recognized immediately by Studio.

Since I was using the Twilio CLI, I needed to add the Twilio token plugin.
I thought that was only recommended, but it turns out to required.

Based on my work to get find the token issue, I suggested a 
[documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/error-handling-diagnostics#android-logging-java)
change from:
````
ConversationsClient.setLogLevel(android.util.Log.DEBUG);
````
To:
````
ConversationsClient.setLogLevel(ConversationsClient.LogLevel.DEBUG);
````
This allowed me to view the debug messages that statement the authorization problem
because the token was generated incorrectly.
Once I added the Twilio token plugin to my Twilio CLI, the token generated fine.

Following is where I added the line into the program: QuickstartConversationsManager.java.
````
...
    void initializeWithAccessToken(final Context context, final String token) {
        Log.e(MainActivity.TAG, "+ initializeWithAccessToken(..., " + token + ")");
        ConversationsClient.setLogLevel(ConversationsClient.LogLevel.DEBUG);
        ConversationsClient.Properties props = ConversationsClient.Properties.newBuilder().createProperties();
        ConversationsClient.create(context, token, props, mConversationsClientCallback);
    }
...
````

## Using the  Conversations API

Documentation [API Overview link](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/api)

A Conversation has the following resources:
[Conversation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/api/conversation-resource),
[Participants](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/api/conversation-participant-resource),
[Messages](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/api/conversation-message-resource), and 
[Conversation Webhooks](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/api/conversation-scoped-webhook-resource)

To get started, I create a sample Node.JS program to manage each of the resources.
For example, a program for each: create, fetch one, list all, update one, and delete one.

Note, to exchange messages with the Conversations command line programs created based on the documentation,
create access tokens using the [Default Conversation Service SID](https://www.twilio.com/console/conversations/configuration/defaults),
not any other Conversations service SID.
Because the documentation command line programs donâ€™t have an option to set the Conversations service SID,
they can only use the Default Conversation Service SID.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Generate a Conversations Access Token

You can generate a token in a few ways:
* Using a [command line](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/create-tokens) and 
[twilio token plugin](https://github.com/twilio-labs/plugin-token) (Recommended)
* Using [Twilio Runtime Function](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions)

For the twilio-cli option, run the following command and enter the resulting token into the strings.xml placeholder:
 ````
twilio token:chat --identity <The test username> --chat-service-sid <ISXXX...>

twilio token:chat --identity dave --chat-service-sid IS973ddbf230364f8dab02c6418779a602
````
Note: You need to generate an access token with a ChatGrant for a Conversations user to use the Twilio Conversations Client SDK.
Manually generated tokens expire after a timeout period. So you will need to replace the token.
To use this in production software, you would typically create a token endpoint in your back end application
that uses your existing user authentication strategy.

Following is the token display using the [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) website.
Note, this token expires in one hour .
````
{
  "jti": "ACa...3-1623781947",
  "grants": {
    "identity": "dave1",
    "chat": {
      "service_sid": "IS97...02"
    }
  },
  "iat": 1623781947,
  "exp": 1623785547,
  "iss": "ACa...3",
  "sub": "ACa...3"
}
````

`test_access_token` is the placeholder in the `strings.xml` resource for the manually generated access token.

Location of the strings.xml file:
````
/.../conversations-quickstart-android-main/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
````
Sample:
````
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">Dave\'s Conversations App</string>
    <string name="error_retrieving_access_token">Error retrieving access token from the server.</string>
    <string name="send">Send1</string>
    <string name="chat_token_url">https://YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE.twil.io/chat-token</string>
    <string name="write_message">Dave: Write Message</string>
    <string name="test_access_token">eyJhbGciOi...pogFA8</string>
</resources>
````

#### Program: MainActivity.java.

App identity is hard coded.
Token string is used here.
Note, the hard coded identity needs to match the identity in the token.
````
/.../conversations-quickstart-android-main/app/src/main/java/com/twilio/conversationsquickstart/MainActivity.java

private String identity = "dave1";

// Token Method 1 - supplied from strings.xml as the test_access_token
quickstartConversationsManager.initializeWithAccessToken(this, getString(R.string.test_access_token));
````

#### Program file, QuickstartConversationsManager.java,

The Conversation name is hard coded.
````
private final static String DEFAULT_CONVERSATION_NAME = "general";
````
