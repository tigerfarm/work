# Implement a Feature Rich Voicemail System

## Features:

+ If the call is answered, the caller does not get a voicemail option.
+ Set your own voicemail greeting message, and a thank you message.
+ If the caller hangs up without leaving voicemail, you will receive a missed call SMS with the callerâ€™s phone number.
+ If the person leaves a voicemail message, you will receive an SMS text message with an active link to the voicemail message. Click/tap on the link to cause your browser to display the voicemail sound file. Click on the browser icon to hear the voicemail message.

For a Twilio Functions and TwiML Bins configuration, click [here](../book/voicemail).

In your Send Message widget's attribute, Body, enter the following:
````
Voicemail received from: {{trigger.call.From}} 
Duration: {{widgets.record_voicemail_1.RecordingDuration}} 
Link: :{{widgets.record_voicemail_1.RecordingUrl}}
````
You can use a Studio Send Message widget to send an SMS with voicemail details and a link to the recording. On my phone, when I tap on the link it causes my browser to display the voicemail sound file link. I click on the browser icon to listen to the voicemail message.

The following shows the a Twilio phone number configured to use the above Studio voicemail flow.
